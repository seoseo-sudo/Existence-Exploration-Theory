# Existence Exploration Theory - Law Evolution Model

## 1. Introduction

In Existence Exploration Theory (EET), physical laws are not absolute givens.  
Instead, they emerge and evolve as optimal configurations selected by continuous informational feedback.

## 2. Law Parameters

The law system is described by a set of evolving parameters:

\[
\mathcal{L}(t) = \{ G(t), F(t), C(t), B(t) \}
\]

Where:

- G(t): Symmetry groups (e.g., gauge symmetries)
- F(t): Field types and interaction structures
- C(t): Physical constants (strengths, ratios)
- B(t): Boundary conditions and compactification structures

---

## 3. Meta-Informational Feedback

As the universe performs experiments, results accumulate into **meta-information** \mathcal{I}(t), which guides law refinement.

The law evolution follows:

\[
\mathcal{L}(t+1) = \mathcal{L}(t) + \nabla_{\mathcal{L}} \mathcal{U}(\mathcal{I}(t))
\]

Where:

- \mathcal{U}: Fitness function evaluating stability, coherence, complexity, and informational efficiency.
- \nabla_{\mathcal{L}}: Gradient of optimization direction.

## 4. The Law Evolution Process

**Step 1:** Generate physical laws: \mathcal{L}(t)  
**Step 2:** Simulate existence under \mathcal{L}(t)  
**Step 3:** Evaluate outcomes and stability  
**Step 4:** Update meta-information: \mathcal{I}(t+1)  
**Step 5:** Adjust laws via optimization: \mathcal{L}(t+1)

## 5. Dynamic Law Evolution Engine

In this framework, even fundamental constants may shift during early existence exploration phases, before stabilizing into coherent frameworks capable of supporting complex structures and life.

## 6. Implication

> **Laws are not imposed; they are self-optimized informational results of existence exploration.**

This provides a unified explanation for:

- Fine-tuning without multiverse assumptions
- Dynamic adaptability
- Ontological parsimony
