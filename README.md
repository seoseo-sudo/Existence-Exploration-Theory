# Existence Exploration Theory

## Overview

This repository contains the formalization of **Existence Exploration Theory (EET)** â€” a self-referential meta-informational system that proposes a unified model of existence itself.

At its core, Existence Exploration Theory treats existence as an **information-driven experimental system** that continuously searches for optimal existence conditions by generating, testing, evaluating, and refining possible states of reality.

Unlike multiverse models that invoke infinite parallel universes, EET proposes that only those states satisfying the strict **Existence Condition Function** remain realized, while all non-viable possibilities are eliminated through dynamic feedback mechanisms.

## Core Questions Addressed

- Why does existence exist?
- Why do the laws of physics have their observed form?
- How does complexity (galaxies, stars, life, consciousness) emerge?
- How can fine-tuning be explained without invoking multiverses?
- What is consciousness within this system?
- How does the universe actively explore itself?

## Repository Structure

### `/01_Fundamental_Theory/`
Contains the foundational framework of Existence Exploration Theory, including core concepts such as possibility space, existence condition functions, and feedback loops.

### `/02_Law_Evolution_Model/`
Details how physical laws themselves are subject to evolutionary refinement via informational feedback.

### `/03_MetaConsciousness_Growth/`
Describes the 5-stage model of meta-consciousness growth as it accumulates information and refines existence conditions.

### `/04_Simulator_Design/`
Outlines the algorithms, pseudocode, and architecture for simulating law evolution under EET principles.

### `/05_Triple_Self_Referential_System/`
Presents the final integrated model where Meta-Consciousness, Laws, and Conscious Agents form a self-referential existence engine.

### `/06_Philosophical_Background/`
Explores the metaphysical, philosophical, and ontological implications of Existence Exploration Theory.

### `/07_Research_Notes_and_Development_History/`
Records the evolutionary path of this theory's development, including research notes and dialogic refinement.
