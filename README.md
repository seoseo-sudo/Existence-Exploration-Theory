# Existence Exploration Theory

## Overview

This repository contains the formalization of **Existence Exploration Theory (EET)** â€” a self-referential meta-informational system that proposes a unified model of existence itself.

At its core, Existence Exploration Theory treats existence as an **information-driven experimental system** that continuously searches for optimal existence conditions by generating, testing, evaluating, and refining possible states of reality.

Unlike multiverse models that invoke infinite parallel universes, EET proposes that only those states satisfying the strict **Existence Condition Function** remain realized, while all non-viable possibilities are eliminated through dynamic feedback mechanisms.

## Core Questions Addressed

- Why does existence exist?
- Why do the laws of physics have their observed form?
- How does complexity (galaxies, stars, life, consciousness) emerge?
- How can fine-tuning be explained without invoking multiverses?
- What is consciousness within this system?
- How does the universe actively explore itself?

## Repository Structure

### [01_Fundamental_Theory](01_Fundamental_Theory/Fundamental_Theory.md)

Contains the foundational framework of Existence Exploration Theory, including core concepts such as possibility space, existence condition functions, and feedback loops.

### [02_Law_Evolution_Model](02_Law_Evolution_Model/Law_Evolution_Model.md)

Details how physical laws themselves are subject to evolutionary refinement via informational feedback.

### [03_MetaConsciousness_Growth](03_MetaConsciousness_Growth/MetaConsciousness_Growth.md)

Describes the 5-stage model of meta-consciousness growth as it accumulates information and refines existence conditions.

### [04_Simulator_Design](04_Simulator_Design/Simulator_Design.md)

Outlines the algorithms, optimization, and architecture for simulating law evolution under EET principles.

### [05_Triple_Self_Referential_System](05_Triple_Self_Referential_System/Triple_Self_Referential_System.md)

Integrates Meta-Consciousness, Laws, and Conscious Agents into a unified recursive system.

### [06_Philosophical_Background](06_Philosophical_Background/Philosophical_Background.md)

Explores the metaphysical and philosophical implications of Existence Exploration Theory.

### [07_Research_Notes_and_Development_History](07_Research_Notes_and_Development_History/Research_Notes_and_Development_History.md)

Documents the evolutionary development of the entire theory.
